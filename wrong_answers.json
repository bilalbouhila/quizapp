{"question_number": 100, "question": "You operate a logistics company, and you want to improve event delivery reliability for vehicle-based sensors. You operate small data centers around the world to capture these events, but leased lines that provide connectivity from your event collection infrastructure to your event processing infrastructure are unreliable, with unpredictable latency. You want to address this issue in the most cost-effective way. What should you do?", "user_answer": [], "correct_answer": ["Have the data acquisition devices publish data to Cloud Pub/Sub."], "Explanation": "Google Cloud Pub/Sub provides a simple, reliable, scalable foundation for event-driven computing systems. By integrating applications with Pub/Sub, they can independently send and receive messages to and from topics and use subscription(s) to consume those messages. This service can be a good fit to publish data reliably from vehicle-based sensors even when connectivity is unreliable or latency is unpredictable. This is also cost-effective as you pay for what you use and it removes the necessity of managing your own Kafka clusters or establishing a Cloud Interconnect.", "All options": ["Deploy small Kafka clusters in your data centers to buffer events.", "Have the data acquisition devices publish data to Cloud Pub/Sub.", "Establish a Cloud Interconnect between all remote data centers and Google.", "Write a Cloud Dataflow pipeline that aggregates all data in session windows."]}
